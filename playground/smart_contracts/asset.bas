/* Private Token Smart Contract Example in DVM-BASIC.
   DERO Smart Contracts Tokens privacy can be understood just like banks handle cash. Once cash is out from the bank, bank is not aware about it (who owns what value), until it is deposited back.
   Smart contract only maintains supply and other necessary items to keep it working.
   DERO Tokens can be tranfered to other wallets just like native DERO with Homomorphic Encryption and without involvement of issuing Smart Contracts.
   Token issuing Smart Contract cannot hold/freeze/control their tokens once they are issued and sent to any wallet.
   This token is Private. Use Function InitializePrivate() Uint64 to make any Smart Contract private.
